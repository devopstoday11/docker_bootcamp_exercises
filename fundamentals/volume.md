## Help

Docker is an open source and popular operating system-level virtualization (commonly known as “containerization”) technology that runs on Linux, MacOS and Windows. Docker makes it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker.

Docker provide an easy command to manage each object. The default format of the command is :

```bash
docker <object> <command> <arguments>
```

The Docker command line take some parameters :
* <object> : The Docker object to manage (container, image, secret, service, etc).
* <command> : A verb defining what to do on the object.
* <arguments> : Some arguments depending on the action.

The recommended approach is to explicitly defined the object that you want to manage. In the case of container management, the recommended command is : docker volume <command>

### Exercise n°1

Get the Docker image management help information from the Docker command line.
