# Overview

## Why Docker

With Docker, developers can build any app in any language using any toolchain. “Dockerized” apps are completely portable and can run anywhere (OS X and Windows laptops, QA servers running Ubuntu in the cloud, and production data center VMs running Red Hat).

Developers can get going quickly by starting with one of the 13,000+ apps available on Docker Hub. Docker manages and tracks changes and dependencies, making it easier for sysadmins to understand how the apps that developers build work. And with Docker Hub, developers can automate their build pipeline and share artifacts with collaborators through public or private repositories.

Docker helps developers build and ship higher-quality applications, faster.

## What you will learn

By the end of this bootcamp you will understand what Docker does. You will also learn how to deploy, scale, update and debug containerized applications on a Docker Swarm cluster.

## How you will learn

This practices are based on usual use cases. The idea is to solve it by applying some techniques, describe in the main part of the course or performing nano projects like managing the same application across all exercises to understand the workflow on a Docker Swarm cluster.

To make it successful, participants need to be prepared in advance, by going through the recommended pre class content to clear the concepts as well as by making sure their systems are prepared with all the software required, before the class. The pre class checklist given below can be handy for this purpose.

## Who is this for

* This course is for someone who do not have any knowledge of Docker and his ecosystem.
* If you are a Operations/Systems personnel and would like to learn how scalable, fault tolerant and high available infrastructures are built on or off cloud to orchestrate container based deployments, this course is for you.
* If you are a developer and would like to learn how to deploy your application stacks in production, on top of scalable, highly available and leverage features provided by Docker, this course is for you.
* If you are a QA, and if your organization has a staging/QA environment built on Docker, and you would like to understand how to leverage it for setting up automated test workflow and learn the primitives offered by Docker, this course is for you.
* You could be developer/operations personnel and be in charge of securing application infrastructure and setup auxiliary services such as monitoring, centralized logging etc. this course is for you.

## What will you do as part of this course

As part of this course you will :

* Design a scalable, resilient, secure solution for deploying microservices application stack in production using primitives offered by Docker.
* Learn how applications from a micro services stack interconnect with services as well as expose public facing services with various options.
* Achieve Continuous Deployment with different release strategies such as Zero Downtime, Blue/Green, Canary, ...
* Learn how to manage storage in a Docker environment.
* Deploy an application which is auto scalable, high available, and resilient to failures.

## What is not covered

Even though this course covers many concepts related to Docker, it still has the following areas uncovered :

* Cloud specific provisioning and integration
* HA deployment of a Docker cluster with multi masters
* In depth Docker administration
* Writing Micro Services Applications

## Which prerequisites are needed

Following are the prerequisite skills to attend this course. Since its a beginner level course, no prior experience with Linux containers is assumed.

* Linux/Unix Systems Fundamentals
* Familiarity with Command Line Interface \(CLI\)
* Fundamental knowledge of code editors
* Understanding of YAML syntax and familiarity with reading/writing basic YAML specifications

## Where to train

There is a lot of way to trained you to manage a Docker cluster and the resources associated :

* Online with the labs [Play With Docker \(PWD\)](https://labs.play-with-Docker.com/)
* Locally on a dedicated cluster deployed on[ Vagrant instances](https://github.com/wikitops/ansible_swarm)
* Locally on a dedicated server deployed on[ Vagrant instance](https://github.com/wikitops/ansible_docker)
